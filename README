= Treequel - an honest LDAP library

Treequel is an LDAP toolkit for Ruby. It is intended to allow quick, easy
access to LDAP directories in a manner consistent with LDAP's hierarchical,
free-form nature. 

It's inspired by and modeled after Sequel (http://sequel.rubyforge.org/), a
kick-ass database library.


== Examples

Here are a few short examples to whet your appetite:

  # Connect to the directory at the specified URL
  dir = Treequel.directory( 'ldap://ldap.yourcompany.com/dc=yourcompany,dc=com' )

  # Get a list of email addresses of every person in the directory (as
  # long as people are under ou=people)
  dir.ou( :people ).filter( :mail ).map( :mail ).flatten

  # Get a list of all IP addresses for all hosts in any ou=hosts group
  # in the whole directory:
  dir.filter( :ou => :hosts ).collection.filter( :ipHostNumber ).
    map( :ipHostNumber ).flatten
