= Treequel - an honest LDAP library

Treequel is an LDAP toolkit for Ruby. It is intended to allow quick, easy
access to LDAP directories in a manner consistent with LDAP's hierarchical,
free-form nature. 

It's inspired by and modeled after Sequel (http://sequel.rubyforge.org/), a
kick-ass database library.
