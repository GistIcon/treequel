= Treequel

Treequel is an honest LDAP library. It is an attempt to remove the impedence
mismatch of trying to treat LDAP as if it's a relational database, and instead
embrace its hierarchical, free-form nature. Its philosophy is modeled after
Sequel (http://sequel.rubyforge.org/), which does the same thing for relational
databases.

You can check out the current development source with Subversion from the
