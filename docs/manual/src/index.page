<div id="auto-toc"></div>

This is a manual for *Treequel*, a Ruby library that is intended to make interacting with an LDAP directory natural and easy. It's built on top of "Ruby-LDAP":http://ruby-ldap.sourceforge.net/, so if you don't already have that installed you'll need to install it, and you'll need to have access to an LDAP server, of course. 

h2(#connecting). Connecting to a Directory

Once those things are done, you can fire Treequel up via IRb and get a <?api Treequel::Directory ?> object to play around with:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a directory." } ?>
$ irb -rtreequel -rubygems

irb> dir = Treequel.directory
# => #<Treequel::Directory:0x69cbac localhost:389 (not connected) base="dc=acme,dc=com", 
#      bound as=anonymous, schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>

The @.directory@ method has some reasonable defaults, so if your directory is running on localhost, you want to connect using @TLS@ on the default port, and bind anonymously, this will be all you need. 

For anything other than testing, though, it's likely you'll want to control the connection parameters a bit more than that. There are two options for doing this: via an "LDAP URL":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4516, or with a @Hash@ of options.

h3(#connect-ldap-url). Connecting With an LDAP URL

The LDAP URL format can contain quite a lot of specific instructions, but @Treequel::Directory@ only uses the scheme, host, port, and base DN parts:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a directory by URL." } ?>
irb> dir = Treequel.directory( 'ldap://ldap.andrew.cmu.edu/dc=cmu,dc=edu' )
# => #<Treequel::Directory:0x4f052e ldap.andrew.cmu.edu:389 (not connected) base="dc=cmu,dc=edu", 
#      bound as=anonymous, schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>

You may omit the base DN in the URL if your environment only has one top level base (or you don't know it!) Treequel will use the first base DN it finds from the server's advertised "namingContexts":http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2251#section-3.4 by default.

It will also use the user and password from a ==<code>user:pass@host</code>==-style URL, if present, and use them to immediately bind to the directory. See "the section on binding":#binding for details.

h3(#connect-options-hash). Connecting With an Options Hash

Creating a directory with an options hash allows more fine-grained control over the connection and binding parameters. It's the same as the hash supported by <?api Treequel::Directory ?>'s constructor:

- @:host@ := The LDAP host to connect to.
- @:port@ := The port to connect to.
- @:connect_type@ := The type of connection to establish. Must be one of @:plain@, @:tls@, or @:ssl@.
- @:base_dn@ := The base DN of the directory.
- @:bind_dn@ := The DN of the user to bind as.
- @:pass@ := The password to use when binding.

Any values which you don't provide will default to the values in @Treequel::Directory::DEFAULT_OPTIONS@.

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a directory with an options hash." } ?>
irb> dir = Treequel.directory( :host => 'localhost', :base_dn => 'dc=acme,dc=com' )
# => => #<Treequel::Directory:0x4f2586 localhost:389 (not connected) base="dc=acme,dc=com", 
#         bound as=anonymous, schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>

h3(#mixing-url-and-options-hash). Connecting with a URL and an Options Hash

You can also mix the two connection styles, allowing you to still use a compact URL, but set the @connection_type@ explicitly, e.g.:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Using both a URL and options." } ?>
irb> dir = Treequel.directory( 'ldap://localhost/dc=acme,dc=com', :connect_type => :plain )
# => #<Treequel::Directory:0x4a0844 localhost:389 (not connected) base="dc=acme,dc=com", 
#         bound as=anonymous, schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>


h2(#binding). Binding to the Directory

If you don't specify a user @DN@ and password, a new @Directory@ object will be bound anonymously, which is usually sufficient for reading the public attributes of records, but it's likely that you'll need to bind as a particular user to write to the directory or access protected attributes:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Binding to the directory as a particular entry." } ?>
irb> dir.bind( 'uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com', 'my_password' )
<?end ?>

You can also bind to the directory using a URL that contains _authority_ information; this is not recommended for production use, as it requires that the password be in plain text in the connection information, but it's supported for convenience's sake:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a directory by URL with automatic binding." } ?>
irb> url = 'ldap://cn=user,dc=acme,dc=com:my_password@localhost/dc=acme,dc=com'
irb> dir = Treequel.directory( url )
# => #<Treequel::Directory:0x4f052e localhost:389 (not connected) base="dc=acme,dc=com", 
#      bound as="cn=user,dc=acme,dc=com", schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>

h2(#rebinding). Binding With A Block

If you want to rebind as a different user for just a few operations, you can do that by calling the @#bound_as@ method and passing it a block that contains the operations which require more privileges:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Executing a block with a different binding." } ?>
irb> dir.bound_as( 'cn=admin,dc=acme,dc=com', 's00per:sekrit' ) { dir }
# => #<Treequel::Directory:0x4f052e localhost:389 (not connected) base="dc=acme,dc=com", 
#      bound as="cn=admin,dc=acme,dc=com", schema=(schema not loaded)>
<?end ?>

Once the block returns, the binding reverts to what it previously was.

There are a bunch of other things you can do with the Directory object, but in most case you won't interact with it directly except as the root of the directory. To interact with the entries in the directory, you'll probably want to start with a <?api Treequel::Branch ?>

h2(#branches). Branches

Once you have a directory, you can fetch entries from the directory hierarchy by traversing the directory hierarchy using Branches. A Branch (<?api Treequel::Branch ?>) is just a wrapper around a DN. The wrapped DN doesn't necessarily need to map to an extent entry in the directory; the entry behind it isn't fetched until it's needed for something. 

You can get a Branch for a DN in several ways. The easiest, once you have a @Directory@, is to use the <abbr title="Relative Distinguished Name">RDN</abbr> from the base of the directory to fetch it. You can fetch a @Branch@ from a @Directory@ or any other @Branch@ by calling a method on it with the same name as one of the attributes of the @RDN@ you want to traverse, and passing the value as the first argument to that method.

For instance, my company's directory has people organized under a top-level <abbr title="Organizational Unit">OU</abbr> called "people", so I can fetch a @Branch@ for it like so:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch ou=people." } ?>
irb> people = dir.ou( :people )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x19a76d4 ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 
#     (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> people.dn
# => "ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com"
<?end ?>

Then you can fetch branches for individuals under @ou=People@ by calling their @RDN@ method, too. Since I happen to know that all of my company's People are keyed by @uid@, everyone's @RDN@ from @ou=People@ will be @uid=«something»@:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch for uid=mgranger,ou=people." } ?>
irb> me = people.uid( :mgranger )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x19a4970 uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389
#     (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> me.dn
# => "uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com"
<?end ?>

You can pass any additional attributes in the @RDN@ (if you have entries with multi-value @RDNs@) as a Hash:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch for an entry with a multi-value RDN." } ?>
irb> hosts = dir.ou( :hosts )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x19a76d4 ou=hosts,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 
#     (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> hosts.cn( :ns1, :l => 'newyork' ).dn
# => "cn=ns1+l=newyork,ou=hosts,dc=acme,dc=com"
<?end ?>

You can also create a Branch from its full DN:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch using its DN." } ?>
irb> me = Treequel::Branch.new( dir, 'uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com' )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x12b676c uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 
#      (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
<?end ?>

or from a raw @LDAP::Entry@ object:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch using its DN." } ?>
irb> entries = dir.conn.search2( 'ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com', LDAP::LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, 
                                 '(uid=mgranger)' )
irb> me = Treequel::Branch.new_from_entry( entries.first, dir )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x129dd70 uid=mgranger,ou=People,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 
#      (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry={...}>
<?end ?>

Branches are also returned as the results from a search, but "that will be covered a little later":#searching.

h3(#branch-attribute-accessors). Reading and Writing Attributes

Once you have a the Branch for the entry you need, fetching its attributes works just like a Hash:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching an attribute." } ?>
irb> me[:gecos]
# => "Michael Granger"
<?end ?>

If you have write privileges on the entry, you can set attributes the same way:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Setting an attribute." } ?>
irb> me = people.uid( :mgranger )
irb> dir.bound_as( me, 'password' ) { me[:gecos] = "Pasoquod Singular" }
irb> me[:gecos] 
# => "Pasoquod Singular"
<?end ?>

Changes to the branch are written to the directory as soon as they're made, so if you have several attributes to change, you'll likely want to make them all at once for efficiency.

h3(#branch-merging). Modifying Several Attributes At Once

You can modify several attributes at once on the Branch via the @#merge@ method:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Merging attributes." } ?>
irb> me.merge( :gecos => 'Michael Granger', :uidNumber => 514 )
<?end ?>

h3(#heirarchical-traversal). Parents and Children

Each branch can also fetch its parent and its children:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Fetching a branch's parent and its children." } ?>
irb> marketing_hosts = dir.dc( :marketing ).ou( :hosts )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x135ad94 ou=hosts,dc=marketing,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 
#      (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> marketing_hosts.parent
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0x13508d0 dc=marketing,dc=acme,dc=com @ localhost:389 (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, 
#     anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> marketing_hosts.children.map {|b| b.dn }
# => ["cn=rockbox,ou=Hosts,dc=marketing,dc=acme,dc=com", 
#     "cn=bone,ou=Hosts,dc=marketing,dc=acme,dc=com"]
<?end ?>

h3(#create-copy-delete-move). Creating, Copying, Deleting, and Moving Entries

If you have a @Branch@ object for an entry which doesn't exist in the directory, you can create it via the @#create@ method:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Creating a new entry." } ?>
irb> new = dir.ou( :people ).uid( :mahlon ).ou( :organs )
# => #<Treequel::Branch:0xfb7b9e954 ou=organs,uid=mahlon,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com @
#    localhost:389 (dc=acme,dc=com, tls, anonymous) entry=nil>
irb> new.create( :objectClass => 'room' )
<?end ?>

h3(#branch-ldif). Getting a Branch's LDIF

A convenient way to look at a branch's entry is via its "LDIF":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP_Data_Interchange_Format string:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Displaying a branch's LDIF." } ?>
irb> puts me.to_ldif
# dn: uid=mgranger,ou=people,dc=acme,dc=com
# gidNumber: 200
